My robot arrived to mars and I want to study my landing to this planet
Mars looks kind of dry and hot might be difficult to breath and to grow anything there how I'm gonna eat?
My robot is moving but nobody cares
I like the pictures of mars it looks kind of empty
HELLO IT'S ENRICO !!
Hello Enrico it's antoine
